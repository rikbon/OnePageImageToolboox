here are some random thoughts

1) when uploading a file, please add also drag and drop, not just upload windows (now it's present only in Resize)
2) crop part is still showing nothing,blank page (still present)
3) when resizing it would be great to have a box near the original image that shows the resized image before downloading  (still present)
4) in all sections, all the buttons should be below the images (still present)
5) in Resize, download button is missing	

Please update gemini.md
